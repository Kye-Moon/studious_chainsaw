I was ace with code, but lacked the imagination and creativity necessary to design great websites. It helped me to realize, engineers only slow the process. Marketers and graphic designers should be in charge of web design. Creative people have all the skills and knowledge, but miss proper web design software. So I started creating a tool for designers so that they can create websites in an environment that is friendly and familiar to them.\n\nSince then, WebWave has grown to over 500,000 users in the EU, and now we want to show WebWave to the rest of the World. \n\nWhat makes WebWave unique?\nOur superpower is that WebWave looks and feels much like a graphic design tool, Figma, Canva, or Photoshop, rather than other website builders. There‚Äôs no invisible table in the background where you have to fit your elements. Instead, you‚Äôve got the freedom and flexibility to position, resize, and style elements however you want. You can work with Layers, and elements can overlay or overlap. We call this ‚Äútrue drag-and-drop‚Äù and it is tailor-made for creative people.\n\nJoin us\nJoin us on our mission to bring back the design from engineers to designers. Start your adventure for free, or use a 50% discount for a 12-month premium plan. We are thrilled to partner with Product Hunt and are committed to giving back to this fantastic community.\n\nThanks for supporting us, and we love to see your feedback in the comments! \n\nPS. Big thanks to @chrismessina for hunting us and for your amazing advice!",
